CCM Mode

Doug Whiting, Russ Housley and Niels Ferguson (http://www.hifn.com/support/ccm.htm,
http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/technotes/newaes.html, http://www.macfergus.com/ )
have proposed a standard that is built on a well established approach for combining
encryption and authentication.  CCM mode, which is described in their paper entitled
"AES Encryption & Authentication Using CTR mode & CBC-MAC", was originally designed
for use with the IEEE P802.11 Wireless LAN but is specified in a way that makes it
more generally applicable.
