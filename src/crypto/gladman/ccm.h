 This code implements the CCM combined encryption and authentication mode 
 specified by Doug Whiting, Russ Housley and Niels Ferguson. 

 The additonal authenicated data in this version is memory resident in a 
 single block and is limited to less than 65280 bytes. The length of the
 mesaage data must be less than 2^32 bytes unless LONG_MESSAGES has been
 defined. This can be input in multiple blocks.

/* This call initialises the CCM context by setting the encryption key 
   and setting up and calculating the the CBC value for the additional 
   authenication data. 
   
   This call is then followed by calls to CCM_encrypt() or CCM_decrypt() 
   to encrypt or decrypt the message bytes. Length values are in bytes. 
   
   The message length value for CCM_init() is the actual number of bytes 
   in the message without the authentication data. This is also true for 
   CCM_encrypt() but the length for CCM_decrypt() is the message length 
   plus the length in bytes of the added authentication data field that 
   is stored at the end of the message.

   CCM_encrypt() and CCM_decrypt() can be called more than once in order
   to process long messages but the overall sum of the data lengths for 
   the set of calls must match the message length (encrypt) or the sum
   of the message length and the authentication field length (decrypt).

   The number of bytes required in the nonce[] array depends on how many 
   bytes are needed to represent the message length in bytes. If 2, 3 or 
   4 bytes are needed to store the message length, then the number of 
   nonce bytes needed is 13, 12 or 11 respectively.
